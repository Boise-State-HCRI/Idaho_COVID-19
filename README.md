# Archive of Idaho COVID-19 Data 

This repository houses COVID-19 data for the State of Idaho collected and processed by Boise State's Hazard and Climate Resilience Institute (HCRI), and used to populate the "Confirmed Coronavirus/COVID-19 Cases in Idaho" map (https://arcg.is/PjmPy). The data have been collected daily from coronavirus.idaho.gov, and are available for public use. Please contact hcri@boisestate.edu with any questions or feedback.

## Available Data:
- Daily counts of new cases by county ("ID_COVID_DAILY_COUNT.csv")
- New and cumulative cases by date ("ID_COVID_CUMULATIVE_BY_DATE.csv")
- Daily screenshots of coronavirus.idaho.gov from 3.20.20 to present
- Data tables scraped directly from coronavirus.idaho.gov from 3.20.20 to 4.1.20 (including reported details on age, sex, testing, and hospitalizations). We stopped scraping on 4.2.20 after the website changed formats and scraping was no longer possible, but have continued to update the "Cases" .csv's manually.
